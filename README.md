Mapping Potential Electoral Busing Zones in Ghana
Overview

This project explores potential electoral “busing” zones in Ghana — areas where illegal voter transportation (busing) is likely to occur, particularly along border towns and high-risk electoral areas. Using spatial analysis, the study provides a framework for monitoring electoral malpractice in the 2024 General Elections.

Objectives

Detect electoral areas vulnerable to busing practices.

Map border towns and roads that may facilitate cross-border voter transport.

Provide spatial intelligence for election observers and policy actors.

Data Sources

Polling data: Electoral Commission of Ghana electoral boundaries and polling stations.

Borders: GADM and national boundary datasets.

Transport: OpenStreetMap road networks.

Contextual evidence: Historical reports on electoral malpractice hotspots.

Methods

Created spatial buffers around border zones.

Analyzed road networks and access routes into Ghanaian electoral areas.

Overlaid polling stations within proximity to borders and cross-border roads.

Classified electoral areas into risk categories based on spatial patterns.

Key Outputs

Risk maps of potential busing-prone electoral areas.

Geodatabase of identified hotspots.

Framework for election monitoring and fraud prevention.

Applications

Strengthening Ghana’s electoral integrity.

Guiding observer missions and election monitoring NGOs.

Academic contribution to spatial forensics in electoral studies.
